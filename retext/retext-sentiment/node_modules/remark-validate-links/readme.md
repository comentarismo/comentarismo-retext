# remark-validate-links [![Build Status][build-badge]][build-status] [![Coverage Status][coverage-badge]][coverage-status] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]

[**remark**][remark] plug-in to validate if links to headings and files
in markdown point to existing things.

For example, this document does not have a heading named `Hello`.
So if I link to that (`[welcome](#hello)`), this plug-in will warn
about it.

In addition, when I link to a heading in another document
(`examples/foo.md#hello`), if this file exists but the heading does not,
or if the file does not exist, this plug-in will also warn.

Linking to other files, such as `LICENSE` or `index.js` (when they exist)
is fine.

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install remark-validate-links
```

## Command line

Use `remark-validate-links` together with [**remark**][remark]:

```bash
npm install --global remark-cli remark-validate-links
```

Let’s say `readme.md` is this document, and `example.md` looks as follows:

```markdown
# Hello

Read more [whoops, this does not exist](#world).

This doesn’t exist either [whoops!](readme.md#foo).

But this does exist: [LICENSE](LICENSE).

So does this: [README](readme.md#installation).
```

Now, running `remark -u validate-links .` yields:

```text
example.md
  3:11-3:48  warning  Link to unknown heading: `world`               remark-validate-links  remark-validate-links
  5:27-5:51  warning  Link to unknown heading in `readme.md`: `foo`  remark-validate-links  remark-validate-links

readme.md: no issues found

⚠ 2 warnings
```

## Programmatic

This plug-in is **not** available on the API of remark.

## Configuration

You can pass a `repository`, containing anything `package.json`s
[`repository`][package-repository] can handle.  If this is omitted,
`remark-validate-links` will try the `package.json` in your current working
directory.

```bash
remark --use 'validate-links=repository:"foo/bar"' example.md
```

When a repository is given or detected, links to GitHub are normalized
to the file-system.  For example,
`https://github.com/foo/bar/blob/master/example.md` becomes `example.md`.

You can define this repository in [configuration files][cli] too.
An example `.remarkrc` file could look as follows:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "validate-links": {
      "repository": "foo/bar"
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration

**remark-validate-links** can detect anchors on nodes through
several properties on nodes:

*   `node.data.hProperties.name` — Used by [`remark-html`][remark-html]
    to create a `name` attribute, which anchors can link to
*   `node.data.hProperties.id` — Used by [`remark-html`][remark-html]
    to create an `id` attribute, which anchors can link to
*   `node.data.id` — Used, in the future, by other tools to signal
    unique identifiers on nodes
